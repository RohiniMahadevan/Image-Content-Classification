# Image-Content-Classification
This project aims to classify the  images into two different categories safe and violent.

**Libraries Needed**

Make sure to install and import the following Python libraries 
- Numpy,
- Matplotlib,
- Tensorflow,
- Streamlit

**Processing the data**

The code uses the Violence and Safe dataset which consists of different graphical violent and graphical safe images. The dataset is divided into train data, test data and validation data.
The data is loaded and resized using the image data generator to read and modify data from the file given.

**Model Used**

We have used the Sequential model in the Convolutional Neural Network to train and validate the data to achieve the desired output.
  
**Coding Approach**
1) Make sure the required Python libraries are installed and imported.
2) Preprocessing the images as mentioned above.
3) Select the model to train the dataset and fit the model using various hyperparameters.
4) Train and test the model by giving the correct parameters needed.
5) Deploy the trained model into Streamlit to achieve the desired results.
